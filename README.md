## What's this?
This is a Chip-8 interpreter written in JavaScript. It runs in a browser and should work fine on a phone. So far only it's only been tested in Chrome and mobile Safari, but should run on any modern browser. You can clone the repo and run index.html through a local server, or just view the project [here](https://yayitsd4n.github.io/chip8/).


## What's a Chip-8?
Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language used in the mid 1970s. It ran on a virtual machine and was created to allow games to be easily made for a multitude of computers and calculators. More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).


## Why did you do this?
As intimidating as it is to me, hardware emulation has always been an interest of mine. While Chip-8 technically isn't hardware, it's often recommended as a good stepping stone due it's simplicity and low number of opcodes.
